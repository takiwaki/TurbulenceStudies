# Introduction

This page summarizes the results of numerical simulations.
The character of the turbulence depends on the dimension and magnetic fields (see table 8.1 of Biskamp ).

The meaning of the variables are as follows. The subscipt $k$ infer the wave number dependence, i.e., those are spectrum.

 | Variables | meaning |
 |---------- | ------- | 
 | $E_k$      | kinetic energy | 
 | $\Omega_k$ | enstropy       | 
 | $H_k^C$    | cross helicity   | 
 | $A_k$      | magnetic potential | 
 | $H_k$      | kinetic helicity | 
 | $H_k^M$    | helicity   |
